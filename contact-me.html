                            A clean and striking design is my end result. But in order to express what is intended to be simple and obvious, I must first find the essence and value for each project. I ask questions, break down information and take my clients through a journey of self discovery. This process, also helps bring focus to their agenda.

                            Having fun at work is very important to me. In addition to learning through it and experiencing positive daily interactions. I enjoy living my true inner philosophy in life - to find joy in everything that I do and engage others in experiencing it with me. I feel that fun is a key ingredient to creative success.
